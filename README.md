# KOSMOS: Knowledge Oriented Symbolic learning for Medical Ontology-based decision System

The KOSMOS framework uses a hybrid approach that combines symbolic and numerical learning methods to
identify patterns that indicate novel correlations between medical items. This method combines the
semantics of symbolic systems, such as ontologies, with numerical learning models like KGE.
By combining domain knowledge, KOSMOS improves downstream tasks such as link prediction,
numerical model performance, and KG completion efficiency. KOSMOS uses domain knowledge to direct the
search space during mining, resulting in efficient recovery of significant patterns.
In this context, domain knowledge refers to the ontological structure and relationships of a KG.
Using semantic context, KOSMOS can identify patterns that are both statistically significant
and relevant to the healthcare domain.
