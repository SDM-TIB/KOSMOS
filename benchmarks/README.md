For the evaluation, we use a dataset that aggregates medical data from various sources, extracted from clinical records of patients diagnosed with lung cancer~\cite{Calvo24}. From this data, we construct a synthetic biomedical benchmark called the Lung Cancer KG. Sensitive information, such as names, identifiers, and dates of diagnosis, births, and deaths, is excluded from the datasets and the Lung Cancer KG. This benchmark models 1,242 lung cancer patients represented by 13,237 triples, 8 predicates, and 1,356 entities that capture patient profiles. Each profile includes characteristics such as smoking habits (e.g., former smoker), demographic details, genetic mutations (e.g., EGFR-negative), and cancer stages (e.g., IIIA or IV). The Lung Cancer KG also encompasses drug information, treatment evaluations, and data on cancer recurrence.
