For the evaluation, we resort to a dataset [6] that aggregates medical data from various sources, including clinical records of patients diagnosed with lung cancer. From this data, we construct a synthetic biomedical benchmark named the Lung Cancer KG. To safeguard privacy, all sensitive information—such as dates of diagnosis, births, and deaths—has been removed. This synthetic benchmark models 1,242 lung cancer patients represented through 13,237 triples, 8 predicates, and 1,356 entities that capture patient profiles. Each profile encompasses characteristics such as smoking habits (e.g., former smoker), demographic details, genetic mutations (e.g., EGFR-negative), and cancer stages (e.g., IIIA or IV). The Lung Cancer KG also contains drug information, treatment evaluations, and data regarding cancer relapse.
